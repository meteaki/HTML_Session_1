    <h2>To Build A Fire</h2>
    <h4 >Jack London</h4>
    
    <p> DAY HAD DAWNED COLD AND GRAY WHEN the man turned aside from the main Yukon
        trail. He climbed the high earth-bank where a little-traveled trail led
        east through the pine forest. It was a high bank, and he paused to breathe
        at the top. He excused the act to himself by looking at his watch. It was
        nine o’clock in the morning. There was no sun or promise of sun, although
        there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a clear day. However, there
        seemed to be an indescribable darkness over the face of things. That was
        because the sun was absent from the sky. This fact did not worry the man.
        He was not alarmed by the lack of sun. It had been days since he had seen
        the sun.</p> <p>The man looked along the way he had come. The Yukon lay a mile wide and
            hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of
            snow. It was all pure white. North and south, as far as his eye could see,
            it was unbroken white. The one thing that relieved the whiteness was a
            thin dark line that curved from the pine-covered island to the south. It
            curved into the north, where it disappeared behind another pine-covered
            island. This dark line was the trail—the main trail. It led south 500
            miles to the Chilcoot Pass, and salt water. It led north 75 miles to
            Dawson, and still farther on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and
            finally to St. Michael, on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a
            thousand more.</p>
